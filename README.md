# Raspberry Pi Weather Monitoring System

This is a Raspberry Pi-based weather monitoring system that reads temperature and humidity values from a DHT11 sensor and reports them to Adafruit IO. It also includes an optional feature to send notifications via IFTTT when the temperature exceeds a threshold.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:

- Raspberry Pi
- DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
- Python 3 installed on Raspberry Pi
- Adafruit_DHT library
- Adafruit_IO library
- Adafruit IO account
- IFTTT account (optional, for notifications)

## Hardware Setup

1. Connect the DHT11 sensor to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pin. Make sure to note down the pin number you used.

## Software Setup

1. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install Adafruit_DHT Adafruit_IO
   ```

2. Create an account on Adafruit IO (https://io.adafruit.com/).

3. Create two feeds on Adafruit IO:
   - Temperature feed: for storing temperature values
   - Humidity feed: for storing humidity values

4. Set up an IFTTT account (optional, for notifications):
   - Create an applet with Webhooks as the trigger and the desired action (email, SMS, etc.).

## Configuration

1. Open the `weather_reporting.py` file.

2. Set the following variables:
   - `ADAFRUIT_IO_USERNAME`: Your Adafruit IO username.
   - `ADAFRUIT_IO_KEY`: Your Adafruit IO API key.
   - `dht_pin`: GPIO pin number connected to the DHT11 sensor.
   - `threshold`: Temperature threshold value for triggering notifications (if desired).

## Running the Project

1. Ensure the DHT11 sensor is properly connected to the Raspberry Pi.

2. Open a terminal on the Raspberry Pi.

3. Navigate to the project directory.

4. Run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python weather_reporting.py
   ```

   The script will start reading temperature and humidity values from the DHT11 sensor and sending them to Adafruit IO. If the temperature exceeds the threshold, it will print a message and trigger the configured IFTTT action.

## Customization

- You can modify the threshold value (`threshold`) in the `weather_reporting.py` file according to your needs.
- If you want to customize the notification or action triggered when the temperature exceeds the threshold, you can integrate with IFTTT by adding the necessary code.
